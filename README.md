# Prework - IOS Prework

Submitted by: Aiden Jeovany Ortega

IOS prework is an app that was constructed to learn the basics of building an IOS app using Swift. In this app, we learned how to implement UI elements and connect UI elements to logic, as well as how to run the app.

Time spent: 2 hours spent in total

## Required Features

The following **required** functionality is completed:

- [Y] Users are see a screen with three labels and a button
- [Y] Tapping the button changes the screen color to a random color

## App Brainstorming (Step 4)

List of fav apps & features:

1. Spotify

- Smart music recommendations and curated playlists
- Offline listening and seamless cross-device playback
- User-created playlists and collaborative playlist features

2. Notion

- Customizable databases and templates
- Seamless integration of notes, to-do lists, and project management
- Clean, minimalist UI with powerful organization tools

3. Instagram
- Close Friends Stories – Lets you share stories with a selected group
  of people instead of all your followers, making it more personal.
- Collab Posts – Allows two users to co-author a post or Reel, meaning
  it appears on both their profiles and shares engagement (likes/comments).
- AR Filters & Effects – Users can create and use interactive augmented reality (AR)
  filters for stories and reels, making content more engaging and creative.

App Idea:

Organization App
 - An app that is designed to organize apps on the home screen according to a variety of methods
   such as by color, type of app, etc. In addition to this organization tool, there could be a
   feature that allows for the automation of the organization of new apps that are installed.
   This app can also create cool widgets or home screen designs/colors to choose from as an
   extra feature. This feature could have the ability to set the iPhone wallpaper to a gif or
   animated image of some sort to add more visuals to one's iPhone wallpaper. 

## Notes
Had to wait a long time for the Xcode to install the IOS 18.2 simulator for my code and features to
be tested.
